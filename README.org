* Description
This layer adds support for the Ebib reference manager.

** Features:
  - Manage references

** Comments
  - To quickly open files from a .bib database it is probably even easier to use
    helm/ivy-bibtex
    
  - To get browser-extension functionality, use of an external reference manager
    might be helpful. For this case it should be noted that JabRef stores and
    manages its database as a .bib file, while Zotero uses an sqlite database.
    Therefore, using Jabref might be prefered.

    Additionally, JabRef does not require a running instance to use its
    browser-extension.

    Finally, if you rely on the Zotero web-api, then you might prefer to stay
    with Zotero and use the [[https://gitlab.com/fvdbeek/emacs-zotero][Emacs-zotero]] package.

* Install
# To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
# add =ebib= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
# file.

To use this configuration layer, clone it to your =spacemacs-private-directory=
either from the command line with
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  git clone https://github.com/dalanicolai/ebib-layer.git .emacs.d/private/ebib
#+end_src
(where you can substitute the path for your private directory if you do not use
the default path),

or from Spacemacs with
=M-: (shell-command (format "git clone
https://github.com/dalanicolai/ebib-layer.git %s/ebib" spacemacs-private-directory))=.


Subsequently add =ebib= to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =ebib= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
